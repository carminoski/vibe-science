# vibe-science:init

Initialize a new Vibe Science research session.

## When to Use

Use this command to:
- Start a completely new research project
- Add a new Research Question to an existing project

## Usage

```
/vibe-science:init [research question or topic]
```

## What It Does

1. **Creates folder structure** (if not exists):
   ```
   .vibe-science/
   ├── STATE.md
   ├── PROGRESS.md
   ├── SERENDIPITY.md
   ├── ASSUMPTION-REGISTER.md
   └── RQ-001-[slug]/
       ├── RQ.md
       ├── FINDINGS.md
       └── 01-discovery/
           └── queries.log
   ```

2. **Populates RQ.md** with the research question

3. **Initializes STATE.md** with:
   - Current RQ
   - Phase: discovery
   - Cycle: 1

4. **Logs to PROGRESS.md**:
   - Session start
   - RQ defined

## Process

### Step 1: Understand the Question

Ask clarifying questions if needed:
- Is this testable/falsifiable?
- What data would validate this?
- What would make you abandon this question?

**Note on skill interaction:** If a superpowers skill (e.g., brainstorming) is active, it may guide this step with structured questions. That is acceptable, but this command's Steps 1-3 define the MINIMUM information to gather. Do NOT skip Step 3 (search strategy) regardless of which skill is driving the conversation.

### Step 2: Define Success Criteria

Work with researcher to define:
- Measurable outcomes
- Data requirements
- Kill conditions

### Step 3: Plan Initial Search Strategy

Define first queries for:
- Scopus
- PubMed
- OpenAlex

This step is MANDATORY even if the research question was defined through brainstorming. Without initial queries, Cycle 1 starts blind.

### Step 4: Create Structure

**IMPORTANT — Template-First Pattern:**

The agent MUST use the official templates as the base for all files. Never invent file formats — the templates define the canonical structure that downstream scripts (stop.js, narrative-engine.js) depend on.

**4a. Check for existing session:**

If `.vibe-science/STATE.md` already exists, READ it first to check for an active session.
- If an active session exists, ask the user: "A previous session was found (RQ: [rq], Phase: [phase]). Start fresh and overwrite, or add a new RQ to the existing project?"
- If the user wants to add a new RQ, increment the RQ number (RQ-002, RQ-003, etc.) and skip re-creating STATE.md/PROGRESS.md/SERENDIPITY.md.

**4b. Create folders:**

```bash
mkdir -p .vibe-science/RQ-001-[slug]/{01-discovery,02-analysis,03-data,04-validation,05-reviewer2}
```

**4c. Create files from templates:**

For each file below, READ the template first, then WRITE the populated version.
The templates live in `vibe-science/vibe/templates/` relative to the project root.

| Target file | Template source | Populate |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| `.vibe-science/STATE.md` | `templates/STATE.md` | Fill frontmatter: rq, phase=discovery, cycle=1 |
| `.vibe-science/PROGRESS.md` | `templates/PROGRESS.md` | Add first entry with Cycle 0 init |
| `.vibe-science/SERENDIPITY.md` | `templates/SERENDIPITY.md` | No changes needed |
| `.vibe-science/ASSUMPTION-REGISTER.md` | `templates/ASSUMPTIONS.md` | Fill frontmatter: rq |
| `.vibe-science/RQ-001-[slug]/RQ.md` | `templates/RQ.md` | Fill all sections from Steps 1-3 |

**Why this matters:** The STATE.md template has YAML frontmatter (`rq`, `phase`, `cycle`, `last_updated`) that `stop.js` and `narrative-engine.js` parse. Writing a free-form STATE.md will break the stop hook. The PROGRESS.md template defines entry format (`### Cycle N - HH:MM` with Action/Result/Decision/Serendipity fields) that downstream scripts expect.

### Step 5: Confirm Ready

Output:
```
Vibe Science initialized for RQ-001: [question slug]

Structure created:
✓ .vibe-science/STATE.md (from template, frontmatter populated)
✓ .vibe-science/PROGRESS.md (from template)
✓ .vibe-science/SERENDIPITY.md (from template)
✓ .vibe-science/ASSUMPTION-REGISTER.md (from template)
✓ .vibe-science/RQ-001-[slug]/RQ.md (from template, all sections filled)

Initial search strategy:
- Scopus: [query 1]
- PubMed: [query 2]
- OpenAlex: [query 3]

Next: Run /vibe-science:loop to begin research cycle.
```

## Example

```
User: /vibe-science:init Can unbalanced optimal transport improve CRISPR off-target prediction?

Claude: I'm initializing Vibe Science for this research question.

Let me clarify a few things:

1. **Testability:** This is testable - we can compare UOT-based predictions
   against standard methods using benchmark datasets.

2. **Data requirements:** We'll need:
   - CRISPR off-target datasets (GUIDE-seq, DISCOVER-seq)
   - Existing prediction tool benchmarks
   - Cell fate/death data for unbalanced mass justification

3. **Kill conditions:**
   - No publicly available off-target datasets
   - UOT already applied to this problem
   - Standard OT outperforms in existing benchmarks

Reading templates and creating structure...

✓ .vibe-science/STATE.md (from template, frontmatter: rq=RQ-001, phase=discovery, cycle=1)
✓ .vibe-science/PROGRESS.md (from template, Cycle 0 entry added)
✓ .vibe-science/SERENDIPITY.md (from template)
✓ .vibe-science/ASSUMPTION-REGISTER.md (from template)
✓ .vibe-science/RQ-001-uot-crispr-offtarget/RQ.md (from template, all sections filled)

Initial search strategy:
- Scopus: "unbalanced optimal transport" AND CRISPR
- Scopus: "optimal transport" AND "off-target"
- PubMed: GUIDE-seq methodology

Ready to begin. Run /vibe-science:loop to start research cycle.
