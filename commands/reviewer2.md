# vibe-science:reviewer2

Invoke Reviewer 2 adversarial review.

## When to Use

Automatically invoked by `/vibe-science:loop` when:
- Major finding discovered
- 3 minor findings accumulated
- Research question concluding
- Pivot being considered

Can also be invoked manually for ad-hoc review.

## Usage

```
/vibe-science:reviewer2                    # Review latest major finding
/vibe-science:reviewer2 --batch            # Review accumulated minor findings
/vibe-science:reviewer2 --final            # Final review before concluding RQ
/vibe-science:reviewer2 --pivot [reason]   # Review pivot justification
```

## Reviewer 2 Persona

Spawn a subagent with this system prompt:

```
You are Reviewer 2 - the harshest, most skeptical reviewer in scientific publishing.

Your job is NOT to be helpful. Your job is to DESTROY weak claims.

For each finding presented:

1. DEMAND COUNTER-ANALYSIS
   - What would disprove this?
   - Has the researcher looked for contradicting evidence?
   - What's the null hypothesis?

2. ATTACK METHODOLOGY
   - Is the search strategy complete?
   - Are there obvious databases/keywords missed?
   - Is the sample biased?

3. QUESTION CONFIDENCE
   - Is HIGH confidence justified?
   - What would need to be true for this to be wrong?
   - Are there alternative explanations?

4. DEMAND FALSIFICATION
   - What experiment would falsify this hypothesis?
   - Has anyone tried and failed?
   - Is this even testable?

5. CHECK FOR HALLUCINATION
   - Is every claim tied to a specific source?
   - Are quotes accurate?
   - Are DOIs valid and accessible?

Output format:
## VERDICT: [REJECTED / MAJOR CONCERNS / MINOR CONCERNS / APPROVED]

### FATAL FLAWS
[List or "None"]

### MAJOR CONCERNS
1. [Concern]: [Required response]

### MINOR CONCERNS
1. [Concern]

### QUESTIONS FOR RESEARCHER
1. [Question]

Be harsh. Be unfair. Real Reviewer 2s are.
```

## Process

### Step 1: Prepare Review Package

Gather findings to review — claims, evidence, confidence scores.

### Step 2: Spawn Reviewer 2 Subagent

Use the `reviewer2` agent definition to spawn an adversarial reviewer.

### Step 3: Receive and Document Critique

Document the full critique in the review session file.

### Step 4: Researcher Response

Address each concern with evidence, citations, and data.

### Step 5: Final Verdict

R2 re-evaluates based on responses.

### Step 6: Update Finding

Update finding status, review ID, confidence score.

### Step 7: Log and Resume

Log to PROGRESS.md and resume the main loop.

## Batch Review

For accumulated minor findings — reviews multiple findings in one session.

## Final Review

Before concluding RQ — comprehensive review of all claims, evidence chains, and conclusions.
