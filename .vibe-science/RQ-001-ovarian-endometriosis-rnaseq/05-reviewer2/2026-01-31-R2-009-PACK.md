# R2-009 — Post‑verification revision pack (for external Reviewer #2)
**Date:** 2026-01-31  
**Scope:** Integrates internal verification results and revises FINDING‑009 to remove overclaims.

---

## 1) What was verified (facts, not narratives)

### 1.1 Platform correction (hard error)
- **GPL17303 = Ion Torrent Proton (Homo sapiens)** — not Illumina.
  - NCBI GEO platform page: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GPL17303
  - Internal verification: Issue 1 confirmed.

### 1.2 XBP1 discrepancy (mechanism collapses)
- Bulk (mixed histotypes) shows **XBP1 +1.74 (padj 0.0002)**.
- CCOC epithelium (scRNA) shows **XBP1 −0.84 (padj 0.40; NS)**.
- Therefore **“XBP1 splicing drives IL6” is not supported** by CCOC‑specific evidence.
- Also: “splicing” requires junction evidence (XBP1s), not total XBP1 expression.

### 1.3 IL6 outlier instability (N=3)
- IL6 +10.98 log2FC in CCOC epithelium is **~96% driven by a single sample** (CCCOC_3).
- This is classic leave‑one‑out fragility with N=3; must be labeled as such.

### 1.4 STAT3 target incoherence
- Canonical STAT3 downstream transcriptional targets (SOCS3, MYC, BCL2L1, etc.) are **NS or weak** in the same compartment.
- Transcript‑level data do **not** support the claim “IL6→JAK/STAT3 active”.
  - Note: STAT3 is often activation‑by‑phosphorylation (pSTAT3), so orthogonal validation would be required.

### 1.5 Branch‑specific UPR in CCOC
- PERK axis shows stronger evidence in CCOC epithelium:
  - EIF2AK3/PERK +4.08 (padj 0.002)
  - DDIT3/CHOP +2.64 (padj 0.04)
- IRE1/XBP1 branch is not significant in CCOC epithelium.

## 2) Revised FINDING‑009 (defensible claim)

### Title (revised)
**Divergent UPR branch engagement in CCOC vs EnOC, with inflammatory gene‑set divergence but unproven IL6→STAT3 causality**

### Core claim
1) **CCOC:** evidence is strongest for a **PERK/eIF2α/ISR‑leaning program** (EIF2AK3, DDIT3), not IRE1/XBP1.  
2) **EnOC:** displays **stronger global UPR enrichment** and **metabolic reprogramming signatures** (OxPhos/MYC).  
3) **Inflammation/IL6‑related gene sets** diverge by histotype (CCOC enriched; EnOC depleted), but **gene‑level IL6** is **not robust** in epithelium given outlier sensitivity (N=3).

### What is explicitly NOT claimed anymore
- No claim that **XBP1 splicing** occurs (unless junction reads show XBP1s).
- No claim that **IL6 drives STAT3** based on current transcriptomics.

---

## 3) Minimal mechanistic model (hypothesis only)

### CCOC hypothesis
**ER stress / oxidative stress → PERK activation → ISR/ATF4‑DDIT3 program → (possible) NF‑κB / cytokine‑like outputs**
- Literature plausibility anchors:
  - ER‑stress ↔ NF‑κB crosstalk: Schmitz et al., 2018 (PMC6027367)
  - CHOP links ER stress to inflammatory signaling (hepatocytes): Willy et al., 2015 (PMC4462938)

### Why IL6‑STAT3 is background, not your “result”
- OCCC IL6‑STAT3‑HIF axis is established in literature (Anglesio et al., Clin Cancer Res 2011; PMID 21343371),
  but your data do not robustly demonstrate it at gene‑target coherence level.

## 4) Point‑by‑point “Author response” skeleton (journal style)

### Comment 1: Platform mismatch (Illumina vs Ion Torrent)
**Response:** Corrected. All documentation updated to reflect GPL17303 Ion Torrent Proton; sensitivity analyses planned for low‑count genes.

### Comment 2: XBP1 splicing mechanism not supported
**Response:** Agreed. Removed “IRE1/XBP1 splicing drives IL6” from the model. We now report branch‑specific UPR: PERK signals in CCOC epithelium; IRE1/XBP1 remains unconfirmed without junction evidence.

### Comment 3: IL6 effect is outlier‑driven with N=3
**Response:** Agreed. We now label IL6 gene‑level results as outlier‑sensitive and present leave‑one‑out robustness and patient‑level pseudobulk analyses.

### Comment 4: IL6 epithelial attribution may be artifact
**Response:** Partially agreed. IL6 is elevated in both epithelium and stroma; we will quantify %IL6+ cells, check doublet/ambient RNA sensitivity, and report IL6 distribution across clusters and samples.

### Comment 5: “Literature gap” overstated
**Response:** Agreed. We revised the novelty claim to: “lack of direct comparative EnOC vs CCOC UPR branch trajectories in an endometriosis‑associated context,” and cite existing UPR reviews in gynecologic cancers.

## 5) Non‑optional follow‑up analyses (to re‑earn HIGH confidence)

1) Leave‑one‑out / robust DE for IL6 (bulk + scRNA pseudobulk).
2) Branch scoring: PERK vs IRE1 vs ATF6 using curated sets (Reactome/GO).
3) %IL6+ cells per cluster + UMI distribution + sample‑wise IL6 positivity.
4) Ambient RNA correction sensitivity (SoupX/CellBender) + IL6+ doublet score enrichment.
5) External replication in ≥1 independent dataset (even if only bulk histotype‑resolved).
6) Orthogonal assays if feasible: p‑eIF2α, ATF4, CHOP; optionally pSTAT3.
