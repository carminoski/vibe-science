## Reviewer 2 Concerns and Responses

### FATAL FLAW #1: Incomplete Search Strategy

**Concern:** Missing synonyms (ER stress, GRP78, XBP1, CHOP, etc.)

**Response:**

Expanded search performed with ALL UPR-related terms:

```
Query: ("ER stress" OR "endoplasmic reticulum stress" OR "GRP78" OR "BiP"
        OR "XBP1" OR "CHOP" OR "DDIT3" OR "ATF6" OR "IRE1" OR "PERK")
       AND endometriosis AND ("ovarian cancer" OR "ovarian carcinoma" OR "EAOC")
```

**Results:**
| Database | Results |
|----------|---------|
| Scopus (expanded) | 3 papers |
| PubMed (expanded) | 1 paper |

**GAP CONFIRMED even with comprehensive synonyms.**

---

### FATAL FLAW #2: No Verification That Gap Is Real

**Concern:** Papers may exist under different keywords (OCCC, endometrioid)

**Response:**

Additional searches performed:

| Query | Results |
|-------|---------|
| ER stress + clear cell ovarian + endometriosis | 2 papers |
| ER stress + endometrioid ovarian | 1 paper (Ciavattini 2018) |

**Same papers appear across queries.** The gap is real across all histotype-specific searches.

---

### MAJOR CONCERN #1: Dataset Accessibility

**Concern:** Datasets claimed but not verified

**Response - VERIFIED:**

**GSE157153:**
- ✅ Downloaded confirmation: ACCESSIBLE
- ✅ Platform: GPL17303 (Illumina RNA-seq)
- ✅ Samples: **66 samples**
- ✅ Conditions: 6 stages of progression
  1. Endometriosis (benign)
  2. Atypical endometriosis
  3. Endometriosis adjacent to clear cell OC
  4. Endometriosis adjacent to endometrioid OC
  5. Clear cell ovarian carcinoma
  6. Endometrioid ovarian carcinoma
- ✅ Raw data: SRA SRP279373

**GSE230956:**
- ✅ Accessible via FTP
- ✅ 8 samples (4 OCCC + endo, 4 benign endometrioma)
- ✅ Both bulk RNA and small-RNA

### MAJOR CONCERN #2: Gap May Be Because UPR Is Irrelevant

**Concern:** Maybe UPR isn't relevant to EAOC

**Response - STRONG BIOLOGICAL RATIONALE:**

Key insight from expanded search:

| Pathway | Papers in EAOC |
|---------|----------------|
| **Oxidative stress** | **139 papers** |
| **ER stress/UPR** | **1-3 papers** |

**Oxidative stress CAUSES ER stress.** This is established biology:
- Oxidative stress → protein misfolding → UPR activation
- ROS → calcium release → ER dysfunction → UPR

**MISSING LINK:** The field has extensively studied oxidative stress in EAOC (139 papers) but almost completely ignored the DOWNSTREAM pathway (ER stress/UPR).

Additionally:
- Ciavattini 2018 found altered UPR gene expression in EAOC
- The paper explicitly calls for follow-up studies
- No one has followed up in 8 years

---

### MAJOR CONCERN #3: PubMed Not Searched

**Concern:** Only Scopus used

**Response:**

PubMed searched with identical expanded query:

```
("ER stress"[tiab] OR "endoplasmic reticulum stress"[tiab] OR
 "unfolded protein response"[tiab] OR "GRP78"[tiab] OR "XBP1"[tiab] OR "CHOP"[tiab])
AND (endometriosis[tiab] OR endometrioma[tiab])
AND ("ovarian cancer"[tiab] OR "ovarian carcinoma"[tiab] OR EAOC[tiab] OR "clear cell"[tiab])
```

**Result: 1 paper**

Cross-database verification confirms the gap.

---

### MAJOR CONCERN #4: Review Articles

**Concern:** Reviews may have synthesized this knowledge

**Response:**

Searched for recent reviews on EAOC molecular mechanisms:

- Found 15 review articles (2024-2025)
- Topics covered: inflammation, somatic mutations, macrophages, immune-metabolic profiles
- **NONE mention UPR/ER stress**

This STRENGTHENS the gap claim - even review authors haven't identified UPR as relevant.

---

### MINOR CONCERN #1: Sample Size Adequacy

**Response:**

GSE157153 has 66 samples across 6 conditions = ~11 samples/group average.
For pathway-level analysis (not single-gene), this is adequate for:
- Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
- Pathway enrichment
- Differential expression of UPR gene signature

---

### MINOR CONCERN #2: Temporal Bias

**Response:**

The 3 papers span:
- 2018 (Ciavattini - pilot study)
- 2022 (Singla - nanomaterials review, tangential)
- 2023 (Hu - ligustrazine review, tangential)

The field has NOT progressed since 2018. The gap is STAGNANT, not closing.

## Revised Finding

**FINDING-001 (REVISED):**

The intersection of UPR/ER stress + Endometriosis + Ovarian Cancer represents a confirmed research gap:

1. **Literature gap:** 1-3 papers (vs 139 for oxidative stress in same intersection)
2. **Biological rationale:** UPR is downstream of oxidative stress - a MISSING LINK
3. **Data available:** GSE157153 (66 samples, 6 progression stages) verified accessible
4. **Review gap:** 15 recent EAOC reviews don't mention UPR
5. **Stagnant field:** No follow-up to Ciavattini 2018 in 8 years

**Confidence: HIGH** (upgraded from initial assessment)
